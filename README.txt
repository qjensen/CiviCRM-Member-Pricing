This module adds the ability to limit access to event price options to selected groups such as Administrators or Current Members. This way you can have a price set that contains all of your pricing options for an event, and the list will be filtered by the users group memberships after logging in. If you want the option to be available to everyone, you can select nothing or choose Everyone to make the selection explicit.

Installation
------------------
Copy this folder into your sites/all/modules folder, got to admin/build/modules and locate the CiviCRM Members Only Event Pricing module and enable it.
You will also need to copy the CRM/Option folder to the folder you have configured as your Custom Templates folder (you can check this at /civicrm/admin/setting/path&reset=1)
