This module adds the ability to limit access to event price options to individuals with select memberships. This way you can have a price set that contains all of your pricing options for an event, and the list will be filtered by the user's memberships after logging in. If you want the option to be available to everyone, you can select nothing or choose Everyone to make the selection explicit.

Installation
------------------
Copy this folder into your sites/all/modules folder, got to admin/build/modules and locate the CiviCRM Members Only Event Pricing module and enable it.
You will also need to copy the CRM/Option folder to the folder you have configured as your Custom Templates folder (you can check this at /civicrm/admin/setting/path&reset=1)

This is the beta release of the Drupal 7/CiviCRM 3.6+ version of the module. It requires the CiviCRM v3 API, and will not work with older versions of CiviCRM.
